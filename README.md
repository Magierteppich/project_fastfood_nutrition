# Project Description

Usually everybody has been to a fast food chain in a lifetime even though everybody somehow knows that this food is kind of unhealthy...but is it really? In order to have a closer look on that topic, we compare three global players (McDonalds, Burger King and Subway) in terms of nutrition against the recommended values from the WHO.

# Questions & Hypotheses

How bad is fast food? And is there any difference between the 3 major chains being McDonalds, Subway, Burger King? 
What about home made burger? 
What is its impact on the global level? (Is there any correlations with the number of restaurants?)

# Dataset
McDonalds nutrition data: https://www.kaggle.com/mcdonalds/nutrition-facts 
BurgerKing: https://burgerking.ca/pdfs/nutrition.pdf 
Subway: https://www.subway.com/en-US/MenuNutrition/Nutrition/NutritionGrid
WHO nutrition recommendation: https://www.dge.de/wissenschaft/referenzwerte/
BMI development over time: http://www.ncdrisc.org/data-downloads.html

# Workflow
1. Download the McDonalds menu dataset from kaggle.com
2. Copying the Subway menu and further process them with Excel
3. Copying the Burger King menu with further processing in Excel
4. Copying the nutrition recommendation values as 
5. Download BMI dataset
6. Data cleaning & Merging all data in one Mastertable via Python
7. Generating visualizations in Tableau

# Going forward: 
- It would be interesting to dive deeper into the question, whether there is any correlation between the number of fast food chains and the increasing global obesity based on focus countries. 
- Do a significant comparison between the different menus to see, whether there are differences between the 3, when it comes to nutrition.
- We havenâ€™t taken into account the chemicals used in processed food, but this is also a key when it comes to fast food.
